# 🚀 DevOps Bootstrap Portfolio

Welcome to my DevOps portfolio—a curated collection of hands-on projects built while completing *The Complete DevOps Bootcamp* on Udemy. This repository reflects my journey from QA Engineer to DevOps practitioner, showcasing real-world implementations of automation, infrastructure provisioning, orchestration, and monitoring.

Each project is designed to reinforce core DevOps principles:
- 🔁 Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)
- 📦 Containerization & Orchestration
- 🧱 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- 🔐 Configuration Management & Cloud Security
